    "description": "myRadex solves essentially the same problem as RADEX (ascl:1010.075), except that it takes a different approach to solve the statistical equilibrium problem. Given an initial distribution, myRadex evolves the system towards equilibrium using an ODE solver.  A function for calculating critical densities of all the transitions of a molecule is included for convenience.",
