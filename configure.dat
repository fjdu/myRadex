! This is an example configuration file for the code to run.
!
! All comments (optional) in this file should be preceded by "!".
! Inline comments should be separated from the content by at least one blank
! space.
!
! The order of the params is not important.
!
! The decimal point (.) is needed for float types without an exponential part.
!   For example, if r is a float number, then r = 1.0 1.0e0 1.0d0 1e0 1d0 are
!   OK, but r = 1 is not (maybe not always, depending on the Fortran
!   implementation).
!
! A few parameters accept vectorized input.  See examples below.
!   . The dimension of these vectors should not be larger than 100.
!   . You can modify the value of the constant ndim_cfg_vec in the source code
!     if you need a larger vector size.
!   . The code will automatically loop over all these vectors.
!     Loop order (outer -> inner): Tkin dv n_x Ncol_x n_H2
!   . Set the vector dimension to 1 to use single value mode.
!
! Note that the number of collisional partners are determined by the input
! molecular data file (e.g. from LAMBDA).
!
! For ortho/para H2, you can provide their densities if you want, or you can
! set *both* of them to zero, and their values will be calculated from the H2
! density.
! In this calculation, if opH2eq3 is set to .true., then oH2:pH2 = 3:1 will be
! assumed, otherwise the ratio will be calculated based on Tkin.
