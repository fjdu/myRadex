C*    Summary:
C     ========
C     Damped Newton-algorithm for systems of highly nonlinear
C     equations - damping strategy due to Ref. (1).
C
C     (The iteration is done by subroutine N1INT actually. NLEQ1E
C      calls the standard interface driver NLEQ1, which itself does 
C      some house keeping and builds up workspace.)
C
C     Jacobian approximation by numerical differences.
C
C     The numerical solution of the arising linear equations is
C     done by means of the subroutines *GEFA and *GESL ( Gauss-
C     algorithm with column-pivoting and row-interchange; 
C     replace '*' by 'S' or 'D' for single or double precision
C     version respectively).

C 
C     FCN(N,X,F,IFAIL) Ext    Function subroutine - the problem function

C       N              Int    Number of vector components (input)
C                             Must not be altered!
C       X(N)           Dble   Vector of unknowns (input)
C                             Must not be altered!
C       F(N)           Dble   Vector of function values (output)
C       IFAIL          Int    FCN evaluation-failure indicator. (output)
C                             On input:  Has always value 0 (zero).
C                             On output: Indicates failure of FCN eval-
C                                uation, if having a nonzero value.
C                             If <0: NLEQ1E will be terminated with 
C                                    IFAIL returned via IERR.
C                             If =1: A new trial Newton iterate will be
C                                    computed, with the damping factor
C                                    reduced to it's half.
C                             If =2: A new trial Newton iterate will
C                                    computed, with the damping factor
C                                    reduced by a reduction factor,
C                                    which must be output through F(1)
C                                    by FCN, and it's value must be
C                                    >0 and < 1.

C
C     N      Int     In     Number of unknowns ( N .LE. 50 )

C     IERR   Int     Out    Return value parameter
C                           < 0 Termination forced by user function FCN
C                               due to IFAIL<0 on output, IERR is set
C                               to IFAIL 
C                           = 0 successfull completion of the iteration,
C                               solution has been computed
C                           > 0 see list of error/warning messages below
C
C*   Error and warning messages:
C    ===========================
C
C      1    Termination, since Jacobian matrix became singular
C      2    Termination after 100 iterations
C      3    Termination, since damping factor became to small
C      4    Warning: Superlinear or quadratic convergence slowed down
C           near the solution.
C           Iteration has been stopped therefore with an approximation
C           of the solution not such accurate as requested by RTOL,
C           because possibly the RTOL requirement may be too stringent
C           (i.e. the nonlinear problem is ill-conditioned)
C      5    Warning: Iteration stopped with termination criterion 
C           (using RTOL as requested precision) satisfied, but no 
C           superlinear or quadratic convergence has been indicated yet.
C           Therefore, possibly the error estimate for the solution may
C           not match good enough the really achieved accuracy.
C     20    Bad input value to parameter N; 1 .LE. N .LE. 50 required
C     21    Nonpositive value for RTOL supplied
C     82    Termination, because user routine FCN returned with IFAIL>0
C
C     Note   : in case of failure:
C        -    use better initial guess
C        -    or refine model
C        -    or use non-standard options and/or analytical Jacobian
C             via the standard interface NLEQ1
